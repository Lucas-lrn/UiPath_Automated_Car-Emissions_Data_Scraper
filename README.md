# Automated Car Emissions Data Scraper

## Project Description
This RPA workflow automates the extraction of car emissions data from the Vehicle Certification Agency website. The bot will navigate the site, apply specific business rules to identify and categorize vehicles as "low," "ultra low," or "zero" emissions. The extracted data, including columns like manufacturer, model, and COâ‚‚ emissions, will then be compiled into a single Excel spreadsheet with three separate sheets for each category, and saved to a specified local directory with a date-based filename.

## Project Objective
The primary objective is to eliminate the manual and time-consuming process of collecting and categorizing car emissions data from a web source. This automation aims to:

- Improve Efficiency: Drastically reduce the time and effort required for data collection.

- Enhance Accuracy: Ensure the extracted data is accurate and correctly categorized according to predefined business rules.

- Ensure Timeliness: Provide a structured, up-to-date dataset for analysis or reporting on demand.
